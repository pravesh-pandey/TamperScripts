```

## Notes

- **Estimates vs Real Data**: The widget shows estimated price ranges. For accurate historical data, click the Keepa or PriceHistoryApp buttons
- **API Limitations**: Both Keepa and PriceHistoryApp require API access for automation, so the script provides convenient links instead
- **Privacy**: Script runs locally in your browser, no data is sent to external servers
- **Performance**: Minimal impact on page load, widget appears after price detection

## Customization

You can customize the widget position by editing these lines in the script:

```javascript
const CONFIG = {
    WIDGET_POSITION: { top: '80px', right: '15px' },  // Change position here
    // ...
};
```

### Responsive Design

The widget automatically adapts to different screen sizes:
- **Desktop**: 260px wide, positioned at top-right
- **Tablet** (â‰¤768px): 240px wide, adjusted spacing
- **Mobile** (â‰¤480px): Full width with margins, positioned at top

## Browser Compatibility

- âœ… Chrome / Chromium / Edge
- âœ… Firefox
- âœ… Safari (with Tampermonkey)

## Troubleshooting

- Refresh the page

**Price shows as N/A:**
