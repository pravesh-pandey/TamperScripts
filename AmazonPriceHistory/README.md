## Notes

- **Estimates vs Real Data**: The widget shows estimated price ranges. For accurate historical data, click the PriceHistory.app or Keepa buttons

- **Privacy**: Script runs locally in your browser, no data is sent to external servers
- **Performance**: Minimal impact on page load, widget appears after price detection

## Customization

You can customize the widget position by editing these lines in the script:

```javascript
const CONFIG = {
    WIDGET_POSITION: { top: '80px', right: '15px' },  // Change position here
    // ...
};
```
